# Online Research: LLM Structured Output Generation Best Practices

**Date**: 2025-11-14
**Researcher**: Claude (research-coordinator)
**Research Depth**: Deep
**Status**: In Progress

## Research Question

What are industry best practices for generating creative LLM outputs while conforming to strict schemas?

**Context**: Meal planning application requiring Claude to:
1. Generate creative, high-quality meal plans (recipes, descriptions, instructions)
2. Conform to specific JSON schema for database storage

**Current Approach**: Two-step process
- Step 1: Generate creative markdown content (no schema constraints)
- Step 2: Extract structured JSON from markdown

## Research Strategy

**Approach**: Parallel deep research combining academic theory with industry practice

**Sub-agents to deploy**:
- **academic-researcher**: Constrained generation algorithms, evaluation metrics, theoretical foundations (Deep research)
- **industry-researcher**: Production implementations, framework patterns, API capabilities, case studies (Deep research)

**Depth rationale**: This is a critical architectural decision impacting cost, latency, reliability, and quality. Need comprehensive understanding of:
- Multiple technical approaches and their trade-offs
- Real-world production patterns and metrics
- API capabilities across providers
- Framework best practices
- Expert consensus and emerging patterns

**Evidence priority**:
- Engineering blogs from AI companies (OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere)
- Production case studies with metrics
- Official API documentation and guidance
- Open source framework patterns (Instructor, LangChain, guidance, outlines)
- Academic papers on constrained generation
